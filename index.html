          Pantheonium is a story I've been working on since 6th grade of primary school. It evolved as my style and interests changed and from a simple story about alchemists it turned into a massive project that tells the story of greek gods and heroes in space. In spare time between university projects I work on writing down the story and expanding it. Currently I'm working on version 5.0 of the story and with help of my friends I can tell it through the Starfinder TTRPG system.

    My papers say my name is Amelia Jędrusiak but you can call me Yu for short. I'm a student at Collegium Da Vinci where I'm on my last year of Game Development. I'm more of a 2D artist but recently I moved more onto code and I'm learning new languages. In my spare time I also sew clothes or crochet.
